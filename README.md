WES - WORKFORCE EFFICIENCY SIMULATOR

TLDR: EARLY DEVELOPMENT (project is early in development and after the core elements have been added, early access will be available)
1. Tool for company to measure the productivity after some change so that they have general idea how changes in company will affect company profit without having to risk resources.
2. Tool that can generate rich backgrounds for bots. Background exists in the same (virtual) world, so bots can be aware of other bots though their past "encounters".

IDEA

As I was creating scrapers and bots, I wanted for bots to have a more humanlike online appearance. For that to work, bot first must have a rich background. Making one is tiring but making more of them with different personalities and backgrounds that sometimes depend on eachother is basically impossible to do manually.
This project, when finished will have two functions as described in the TLDR at the top of the page.

1. SIMULATOR

First and core functionality of this project is to simulate a corporate world. World will be created with the starting population and starting corporations. The virtual population should closely reflect the size and diversity of the real-world population. Here are some planed features that a person will have:

  - Personal traits
  - Reproduction
  - Genetics (traits from parents will mix and create infinite combinations of traits, sometimes good, sometimes bad that will affect their virtual life)
  - Death (humans with low production will not earn enough to support themselves and will die, crime as means of survival will probably not be implemented)
  - Compatibility (some people just work better with others who have similar traits, in turn increasing their productivity, and vice versa.)
  - Environment (people with specific traits love, or hate, certain work environments that will again, affect productivity)
  - And much more

World will simulate the economy as much as possible, so corporations will compete with each other, potentially go bankrupt, acquire smaller competitors, and grow or shrink based on their market actions and treatment of employees. Corporations will try to mimic the real world corporation structure and their way of handling the business.

When the project is completed, user will have various options to change almost anything they want. For example, company will hire people based on some criteria it thinks its the best, but you can change parameters for hiring and/or hire specific employee for that company, create person with traits you like (or dislike) to see how will he do in non-ideal (or ideal) work environment, etc...

2. BOT background

   Side effect of this simulation is that people will be simulated like real people and live days (to an extent) as real people, so you could stop simulation after 10 virtual years for example and pull out one or more people from the simulation with all their background, work skills, traits, parrents, etc. which can further be used as a starting point for a bot so it appears more human on the internet.
